I'm a first-year computer science PhD student at University of Illinois at Chicago. I'm a member of [BITS Networked Systems Laboratory](https://www.cs.uic.edu/bin/view/Bits/) where I'm being advised by [Chris Kanich](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~ckanich/). My current research project is focused on analyzing security and privacy implications of social authentication methods in web and mobile platforms.
